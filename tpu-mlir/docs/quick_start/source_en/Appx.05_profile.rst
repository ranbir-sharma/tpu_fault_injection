Appendix.05ï¼šTPU Profile Tool Guidance
========================================

This chapter mainly introduces how to use Profile data and Tensor Computing Processor Profile tools to visualize the complete running process of the model to facilitate model performance analysis.

Compile Bmodel
------------------

TPU Profile is a tool for converting Profile data into visual web pages. First, generate bmodel. The following uses the yolov5s model in the tpu-mlir project to demonstrate.

Since Profile data will save some layer information during compilation into bmodel, causing the size of bmodel to increase, it is turned off by default. The way to open it is to call ``model_deploy`` with the ``--debug`` option. If this option is not turned on at compile time, some data will be missing when the data obtained by turning on Profile at runtime is visualized. The command to generate a bmodel within Docker is as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

   # generate top mlir
   $ model_transform \
       --model_name yolov5s \
       --model_def ../yolov5s.onnx \
       --input_shapes [[1,3,640,640]] \
       --mean 0.0,0.0,0.0 \
       --scale 0.0039216,0.0039216,0.0039216 \
       --keep_aspect_ratio \
       --pixel_format rgb \
       --output_names 350,498,646 \
       --test_input ../image/dog.jpg \
       --test_result yolov5s_top_outputs.npz \
       --mlir yolov5s.mlir

.. code-block:: shell

   # convert top mlir to fp16 precision bmodel
   $ model_deploy \
       --mlir yolov5s.mlir \
       --quantize F16 \
       --processor bm1684x \
       --test_input yolov5s_in_f32.npz \
       --test_reference yolov5s_top_outputs.npz \
       --model yolov5s_1684x_f16.bmodel \
       --debug

Through the above commands, ``yolov5s.onnx`` is compiled into ``yolov5s_bm1684x_f16.bmodel`` , and the ``--debug`` parameter will record the profile data.

Generate Raw Profile Data
--------------------------

Copy the generated ``yolov5s_bm1684x_f16.bmodel`` to the running environment with libsophon. In the same compilation process, the Profile function at runtime is turned off by default to prevent additional time consumption when saving and transmitting profiles. When you need to enable the profile function, set the environment variable ``BMRUNTIME_ENABLE_PROFILE=1`` before running the compiled application. Then use the model testing tool ``bmrt_test`` provided in libsophon to run bmodel and generate profile data. Execute the following command outside of Docker:

.. code-block:: shell

    export BMRUNTIME_ENABLE_PROFILE=1
    bmrt_test --bmodel yolov5s_1684x_f16.bmodel

The following is the log output after opening Profile:

.. _profile_log:
.. figure:: ../assets/profile_log_en.png
   :height: 13cm
   :align: center

   The log output after opening Profile

After the run completes, the ``bmprofile_data-1`` folder is generated in the current directory, which contains all Profile data.


Visualize Profile Data
--------------------------

Copy the ``bmprofile_data-1`` directory back to the tpu-mlir project environment inside Docker. Tpu-mlir provides the ``tpu_profile`` script to convert the generated profile data into a web page file for visualization. Execute the following command inside Docker:

.. code-block:: shell

    # Convert the original profile data in the bmprofile_data_0 directory into a web
    # page and place it in the bmprofile_out directory
    # If there is a graphical interface, the browser will be opened directly and the
    # results will be seen directly.
    tpu_profile bmprofile_data-1 bmprofile_out
    ls bmprofile_out
    # echarts.min.js  profile_data.js  result.html

Open ``bmprofile_out/result.html`` with a browser to see the profile chart. In addition, there are other uses of this tool, which can be viewed through the command as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

   tpu_profile --help
